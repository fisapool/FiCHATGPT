- Service-oriented design with proper encapsulation
- Structured message passing between components
- Comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms

### GitHub Integration
**BytesCookies:**
- Simple GitHub token input and storage
- Basic API calls for repository access
- Limited error feedback for users
- Single cookie format support
- No fallback mechanisms for failures

**FiCHATGPT:**
- Fully automated centralized cookie management system
- No user knowledge of GitHub required
- Secure API-based authentication with license keys
- Detailed error logging and user feedback
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for resilience
- Automated recovery from temporary API issues
- Seamless cross-device synchronization

### Security Enhancements
**BytesCookies:**
- Basic cookie encryption
- Limited data validation
- Minimal protection against token misuse

**FiCHATGPT:**
- Advanced AES encryption for all sensitive data
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Device fingerprinting for license enforcement
- Token rotation and permission verification

### Cookie Session Management
**BytesCookies:**

## External Resources

### Secret Storage

The project uses a separate repository for storing sensitive configuration and secrets:

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/fisapool/json](https://github.com/fisapool/json)
- **Purpose**: Securely store configuration values, API keys, and other sensitive data
- **Integration**: The main application fetches configuration from this repository as needed
- **Security**: Keeps sensitive data separate from the main codebase for enhanced security

### Authentication Flow

1. User purchases license via Shopee and redeems at fisamy.rhinopal
2. User installs the FiCHATGPT extension in their browser
3. User enters their license key in the extension
4. The extension authenticates with FISABytes server and activates the license
5. Session cookies are automatically synchronized and managed
6. ChatGPT access is enhanced with increased message capacity and stability

## Session Cookie Support

The extension fully supports session-based cookies for ChatGPT authentication:

```json
{
  "url": "https://chatgpt.com/",
  "cookies": [
    {
      "domain": "chatgpt.com",
      "hostOnly": true,
      "httpOnly": true,
      "name": "__Host-next-auth.csrf-token",
      "path": "/",
      "sameSite": "lax",
      "secure": true,
      "session": true,
      "storeId": "0",
      "value": "..."
    },
    // Additional cookies...
  ]
}
```

This format is automatically handled by the CookieManager with robust validation and processing.

## Tools for Cookie Verification

The project includes several tools to help verify GitHub cookie loading:

1. **token-checker.html** - Verify GitHub token status and validity
2. **cookie-path-checker.js** - Check if cookies exist in expected GitHub paths
3. **cookie-validation-tester.html** - Validate cookie format and structure
4. **github-cookie-debugger.js** - Enhanced logging for extension debugging

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or higher
- NPM or Yarn package manager
- Access to the [fisapool/json](https://github.com/fisapool/json) repository for secrets

### Installation
1. Clone the main repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fisapool/FiCHATGPT.git
cd FiCHATGPT
```

2. Set up access to the secrets repository (contact repository admin for access):
```bash
# In a separate directory
git clone https://github.com/fisapool/json.git
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Configure the application to use the secrets:
```bash
# Create a .env file with the path to your secrets repository
echo "SECRETS_PATH=/path/to/fisapool/json" > .env
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://0.0.0.0:5000

### Working with GitHub Integration (For Developers Only)
- The extension uses a centralized GitHub repository for cookie management
- End users don't need to interact with GitHub or create tokens
- For development and testing, you'll need access to the development repository:
  - Contact the project admin for development repository access
  - Use the GitHub Sync Manager service for local testing
  - See the `docs/developer-github-integration.md` file for development setup

### Working with Secrets
- Never commit secrets directly to the main repository
- Always use the dedicated secrets repository for sensitive data
- When deploying, ensure the CI/CD pipeline has secure access to the secrets repo
- Rotate secrets regularly according to security best practices

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run watch` - Build with watch mode
- `npm run check` - Type checking
- `npm run test` - Run tests
