# Firefox Compatibility Testing for FiCHATGPT

This document outlines the testing procedures, common issues, and verification checklist for ensuring FiCHATGPT works correctly in Firefox browsers.

## Firefox Extension Requirements

Firefox extensions have some differences compared to Chrome-based extensions:

1. **Manifest Differences**:
   - Firefox supports both `manifest_version` 2 and 3, but has some implementation differences
   - Some permission names and capabilities differ from Chrome
   - Content Security Policy implementation varies

2. **API Compatibility Issues**:
   - Firefox's `browser.*` API (promise-based) vs Chrome's `chrome.*` API (callback-based)
   - Different behavior in cookie handling and storage access
   - Variations in background script implementation

3. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Popup rendering differences
   - CSS compatibility issues
   - Different default styles and behaviors

## Testing Environment Setup

1. **Firefox Versions**:
   - Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release): 115.x
   - Firefox Stable: Latest version (119+)
   - Firefox Developer Edition: Latest version

2. **Testing Profiles**:
   - Create a clean Firefox profile for testing
   - Test with both default settings and custom privacy settings
   - Test with other extensions installed (to check for conflicts)

3. **Loading the Extension**:
   - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the extension's manifest.json
   - Alternatively, package as .xpi and install through `about:addons`

## Compatibility Test Checklist

- [ ] Validate content security policy settings

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Cookie Export
  - [ ] Can access and export OpenAI cookies
  - [ ] Export format is correct and complete
  - [ ] UI feedback is appropriate

  - [ ] Authentication flow works
  - [ ] Token handling functions properly
  - [ ] Session enhancement is applied correctly

- [ ] License Management
  - [ ] Device fingerprinting works in Firefox
  - [ ] License activation completes successfully
  - [ ] License status is displayed correctly

### UI Testing

- [ ] Popup renders correctly
  - [ ] No layout issues or overflow
  - [ ] All tabs are accessible
  - [ ] Forms function properly
  
- [ ] Responsive behavior
  - [ ] UI adapts to different window sizes
  - [ ] Input fields are properly sized
  
- [ ] Visual consistency
  - [ ] Icons display correctly
  - [ ] Fonts render as expected
  - [ ] Animations work smoothly

### Error Handling

- [ ] Connection errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid input errors show appropriate messages
- [ ] API failures provide useful feedback
- [ ] Security errors are properly managed

## Common Firefox-Specific Issues

### Storage API Differences

Firefox's implementation of the Storage API might behave differently than Chrome. Test:
- Local storage persistence
- Synced storage behavior
- Storage event listeners

### Cookie Access Limitations

Firefox has stricter cookie access policies:
- First-party isolation might affect cookie access
- Enhanced Tracking Protection can block cookie operations
- Container tabs may interfere with cookie management

### Extension Lifecycle Variations

- Background script loading/unloading behavior differs
- Event handling and message passing have subtle differences
- Performance characteristics may vary

## Testing Protocol

1. **Installation Testing**:
   - Install extension in Firefox
   - Verify all permissions are granted
   - Check extension appears in toolbar

2. **Functionality Verification**:
   - Step through each core feature systematically
   - Document any differences from Chrome behavior
   - Test with various OpenAI account types

3. **Error Recovery Testing**:
   - Deliberately cause errors to test recovery
   - Test with network disconnections
   - Test with invalid cookies/data

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure popup load time
   - Check memory usage
   - Verify CPU usage during operations

## Firefox-Specific Adaptations

If issues are found during testing, consider these common solutions:

1. **API Compatibility Layer**:
   ```javascript
   // Example of cross-browser compatibility wrapper
   const browserAPI = (typeof browser !== 'undefined') ? browser : chrome;
   
   // Promise-based wrapper for Chrome callback style
   function promisify(callbackFn) {
     return (...args) => {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         callbackFn(...args, (result) => {
           if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
             reject(chrome.runtime.lastError);
           } else {
             resolve(result);
           }
         });
       });
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Manifest Adjustments**:
   - Include Firefox-specific manifest entries when necessary
   - Consider maintaining separate manifest files for different browsers

3. **Polyfills for Missing Features**:
   - Identify and implement workarounds for unsupported features
   - Use feature detection to apply different code paths

## Test Results Documentation

For each test run, document:
- Firefox version and profile details
- Date and tester name
- Pass/fail status for each checklist item
- Screenshots of any issues
- Detailed description of observed behavior vs expected behavior

## Regression Testing

After making Firefox-specific fixes:
- Re-test on Chrome to ensure compatibility is maintained
- Test on Edge to verify WebExtension API compatibility
- Consider automated cross-browser testing where possible
